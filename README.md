Orbital Project for team continue;

To Nelvin:
Use the account I handed over to you to familiarise yourself with Android Studio and Android Development.
I have currently set up the registration/signin portion of the project, when I get back on 13 June then we can discuss and continue the
project. Should be easier this way if we are both able to work on the project at the same time, will reduce confusion lol.

Just give me a heads up if you do want to make any changes though! :)
