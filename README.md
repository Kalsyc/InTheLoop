# InTheLoop
Orbital Project for team continue;

To Nelvin:
Use the account I handed over to you to familiarise yourself with Android Studio and Android Development.
I have currently set up the registration/signin portion of the project, when I get back on 13 June then we can discuss and continue the
project. Should be easier this way if we are both able to work on the project at the same time, will reduce confusion lol.

Just give me a heads up if you do want to make any changes though! :)

Git Setup:
From the welcome screen (if you have a project open, go to File -> Close project), click Checkout from Version Control
From the GitHub page that I shared with you, click the green Clone/Download button
Copy the URL
Paste into the field in Android Studio
Click Clone
Wait for Gradle to build finish (check the bottom right to see if finished alr)
Follow Git SOP (Pull, edit, commit+push)


Git SOP:
Always pull before you start working on the project!
Make changes (we will be working on separate parts so to reduce overlap)
When done, commit and push


Current progress:
Activities set up for Login, Register, Events List
Firebase already set up for user authentication and database
